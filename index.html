      Eating my vegetables By Mia Leimkuhler Hello! Mia here, the newsletter
      editor for New York Times Cooking, filling in for Emily. I hope everyone
      is enjoying a happy and healthy new year. I am a grown woman who enjoys
      eating her vegetables. I say this not as a terrifically awkward
      introduction, but as a reminder to myself.

      When it’s cold and dark and
      somehow only Wednesday, I tend to slide into dinners that resemble those
      an unsupervised toddler would assemble: chips and salsa, a fistful of
      cookies, a piece of cheese with five slices of bread. Which is why I’ve
      begun seeking out — and cooking on repeat — recipes that welcome
      increasing their vegetable matter, particularly those good-for-you leafy
      greens. Am I essentially hiding vegetables from myself? Yes. Am I
      effortlessly upping the nutritional and virtuous content of my easy
      dinner? Also yes.
