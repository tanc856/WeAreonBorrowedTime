      AKQA predicts how tech could influence design this year, across gaming,
      travel and more With insights from across the AKQA team, we explore how
      new technology could enhance creative projects in the year ahead, and how
      it might affect five industries across health and wellbeing, to gaming,
      travel, automotive and luxury.

        >It’s Nice That’s 2024 Forward Thinking series is supported by AKQA, the
        globally renowned design and innovation company. AKQA is at the
        forefront of creative technologies, telling unforgettable narratives
        across service, experience and product design that capture the

      We’ve entered into a new phase of creativity. Since the arrival of AI, the
      mixed reality, bitcoin and everything else, the creative industry – and
      world at large – has seen a dramatic shift. From easier processes to
      innovations that defy pre-existing boundaries, technology has enabled
      designers, makers and artists to reach new heights in their creations. But
      as the old saying goes, it’s now all about quality rather than quantity.
      No longer are we using tech for the sake of tech; instead, it’s being used
      to elevate the user experience, reach younger generations, improve mental
      health, and a whole lot more.

      AKQA, an agency that centres its ethos on crafting immersive, user-centric
      experiences, has been leading the way when it comes to using technology in
      a pioneering and authentically beneficial way. Now celebrating its 30-year
      anniversary, the team have garnered a vast portfolio filled with work
      across the industries from luxury and automotive to gaming, travel and
      health, each of which merges technology with compelling narratives to
      forge meaningful brand-to-consumer connections. Below, we’ve called in
      some help from the AKQA team to understand how new technologies are
      changing these industries, and how designers can implement these tools in
      the future.

      Additionally, there’s been a large shift towards more digital
      interactions, as seen in Eurostar Odyssey, an on-board virtual reality
      experience designed for the rail service by the AKQA team. Once travellers
      place on the headset, they embark on a journey deep into the sea – the
      roof of the train transforms into a glass ceiling, revealing the an
      underwater world. Another example can be seen within the customer service
      space. For instance, AI is being used as a co-pilot on planes, and travel
      brands are incorporating self-service approaches to help resolve issues in
      real-time. Roman explains how this is of particular interest to the Gen-Z
      traveller, who prefers a more customised approach rather than having to
      call in and go through multiple avenues to change a flight time.
      Flexibility and a focus on sustainability is driving the digital
      transformation. “The brands that will focus on these overarching
      experience needs will earn a larger share of travellers’ wallets and drive
      the industry drastically forward in the coming years,” says Roman.
