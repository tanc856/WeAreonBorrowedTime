      NEGOTIATING UNGERS the construction of communities international summer
      school 2021 in 1972, oswald mathias ungers and his students at cornell
      university in ithaca, ny, developed a prototype for a SELF-HELP HOUSING
      SYSTEM (s-hhs). shortly before, ungers and his wife liselotte started a
      research project on UTOPIAN COMMUNITIES in the usa; the study was
      published in 1972 under the title “communes in the new world 1740–1972”.
      this coincidence inspired our THIRD SUMMER SCHOOL, which was held in july
      2021 with students from the ku leuven, faculty of architecture, and the
      kunstakademie düsseldorf.

      the self-help housing system (s⁠-⁠hhs) in 1969, oswald mathias ungers
      moved from his job at the technical university of berlin to cornell
      university. STUDENT PROTESTS had impacted heavily on his teaching in
      berlin and his project for the MÄRKISCHES VIERTEL, a large-scale housing
      development at the outskirts of berlin, had been hit by harsh criticism of
      mass housing in the media. in the us, ungers continued his research on
      building systems for housing. however, he entered a process of REFLECTION
      and reassessment.1 it is in this context that the design for the self-help
      housing system took shape. as a studio project, it was also decisively
      influenced by a climate of social change in light of the civil rights
      movement and student protests, which called for a RESTRUCTURING of
      ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION AND PRODUCTION. a previous STUDIO PROJECT AT
      CORNELL had realized an initial exploration of modular housing types made
      from timber elements.
