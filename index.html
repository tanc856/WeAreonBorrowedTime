        ** is a week-long documentation on how much time we lose based on the
        notifications we receive. Each column indicates one mobile application with passive notifications (sent in the background). Interrupted content appears when there are active All documentations
        are recorded based on phone usage. As technology becomes more intimate
        and intertwined with our lives, it raises fundamental questions about
        the nature of our relationship with these digital artifacts and the
        responsibilities inherent in their usage. How do we navigate the
        boundless expanse of information and stimuli at our fingertips without
        succumbing to overwhelm or cognitive overload? How can we cultivate
        mindfulness and intentionality in our digital consumption habits,
        reclaiming agency over our attention and priorities in an era defined by
        perpetual connectivity?

        We’ve entered into a new phase of creativity. Since the arrival of AI,
        the mixed reality, bitcoin and everything else, the creative industry –
        and world at large – has seen a dramatic shift. From easier processes to
        innovations that defy pre-existing boundaries, technology has enabled
        designers, makers and artists to reach new heights in their creations.
        But as the old saying goes, it’s now all about quality rather than
        quantity. No longer are we using tech for the sake of tech; instead,
        it’s being used to elevate the user experience, reach younger
        generations, improve mental health, and a whole lot more.

        AKQA, an agency that centres its ethos on crafting immersive,
        user-centric experiences, has been leading the way when it comes to
        using technology in a pioneering and authentically beneficial way. Now
        celebrating its 30-year anniversary, the team have garnered a vast
        portfolio filled with work across the industries from luxury and
        automotive to gaming, travel and health, each of which merges technology
        with compelling narratives to forge meaningful brand-to-consumer
        connections. Below, we’ve called in some help from the AKQA team to
        understand how new technologies are changing these industries, and how
        designers can implement these tools in the future.

        Additionally, there’s been a large shift towards more digital
        interactions, as seen in Eurostar Odyssey, an on-board virtual reality
        experience designed for the rail service by the AKQA team. Once
        travellers place on the headset, they embark on a journey deep into the
        sea – the roof of the train transforms into a glass ceiling, revealing
        the an underwater world. Another example can be seen within the customer
        service space. For instance, AI is being used as a co-pilot on planes,
        and travel brands are incorporating self-service approaches to help
        resolve issues in real-time. Roman explains how this is of particular
        interest to the Gen-Z traveller, who prefers a more customised approach
        rather than having to call in and go through multiple avenues to change
        a flight time. Flexibility and a focus on sustainability is driving the
        digital transformation. “The brands that will focus on these overarching
        experience needs will earn a larger share of travellers’ wallets and
        drive the industry drastically forward in the coming years,” says Roman.
